description="Dapps are all the rave, but there's no consensus about how they should be built. \n\n There's a cambrian explosion of developer tools and many emerging design patterns using IPFS. This introduction will set the stage for some of the fantastic speakers we have during the day who'll be sharing the state of the art in app design patterns and developer tools."

description="In this talk, we'd like to share the ideas and technical approaches we came up with while building [Mintter](https://mintter.com/) on top of IPFS for the past 2.5 years. Some of the challenges we faced didn‚Äôt have easy, or plug-and-play solutions at the time, such as multi-device, decentralized identity, version control, etc. Mintter is a hypertext system for knowledge management in open discussion groups. While working on the product, we were greatly inspired by the work of the founding fathers of hypertext: Doug Engelbart, Ted Nelson and others."

Start with DID-based self-sovereign auth, a great opportunity to learn about the next wave of digital identity, and write code to upload files as well as JSON objects. They'll discuss IPFS data structures like IPLD trees and graphs, and how they can be used in applications."

It will touch on the p2p aspects of the app, the nature of distributed apps, and how a blockchain layer is optional when building distributed apps. Then it will continue explaining the high-level plan for the app and the goals that were set.

Finally, it will touch on the implementation details, the dragons, the groundwork, the how-tos and gotchas of using a shared data structure (CRTD) between peers, and a demo of the gif-sharing app.

It is used in a distributed event sourcing system at https://www.actyx.com/ , but can also be used in other situations where an efficient append only log or rolling log is needed.

I will explain the tree data structure of banyan, how to adapt it to your own needs, and discuss lessons learned when implementing a relatively complex data structure on top of IPFS and IPLD.

Banyan is currently implemented in rust, with Apache and MIT license.
