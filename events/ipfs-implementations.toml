  Are you looking to choose the right IPFS implementation to build on? Do you want to find an IPFS implementation to _work_ on? This track aims to answer both.
  
  Meet the teams taking IPFS to the next level. Find an implementation that you can bet your project on, or if you dare, let yourself be nerd sniped into working on the protocol itself.

title="A new approach to IPFS pinning and caching"
description="""
Ipfs-Embed is a small embeddable version of a subset of IPFS, written in rust. It is used in production in the German manufacturing industry.

This talk will present a novel API for pinning, caching and garbage collection that is designed for the use case of highly interactive and dynamic applications with soft real time requirements.

Afterwards there will be a discussion about advantages and disadvantages of this approach, and how it compares to the Kubo API.
