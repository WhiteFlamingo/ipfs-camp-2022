title="Chrome pre-defined Custom Handlers for IPFS"
description="High-level overview of the refactoring Implemented in Chrome's source code to define a dedicated component for the Custom Handlers logic. Thanks to this refactoring, we have improved the support for Chrome embedders to implement their own pre-defined Custom Handlers for the schemes they consider strategic. Patching Chrome to add a pre-defined Custom Handler to manage IPFS schemes is now trivial, reducing considerably the efforts of embedders to deal with rebases in order to sync with Chrome upstream."

description="The Webrecorder project open source tools to 'record' web pages as they load, creating high-fidelity interactive web archives which can then be stored on IPFS in a standard format. These interactive archives can then be loaded directly in the browser, much like video or PDFs, using custom viewer tools. This session will provide a brief intro to high fidelity web archiving workflows and tools."
